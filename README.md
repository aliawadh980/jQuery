## Multiple Ajax calls with final result when all finished
The problem we are trying to fix here is: we need to make multiple ajax calls, each gets its own asynchronous result, then when all finished we need to take an action. For this example, we just change the text in the Div areas.
The files:
*	[multiple_ajax_with_final.php](multiple_ajax_with_final.php) - Has all the code with 4 buttons each one is an ajax call.
* [php1.php](php1.php) - The first 3 buttons uses the output of this file, which is simple file outputs text with some delay.
* [php2.php](php2.php) - The fourth button this file and outputs simple json output.
